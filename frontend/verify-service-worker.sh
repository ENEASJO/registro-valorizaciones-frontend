# Summary

echo "üìä Implementation Summary:"
echo "=========================="

echo "üéØ Key Issues Fixed:"
echo "  1. ‚úÖ Removed all Turso references from useEmpresas hook"
echo "  2. ‚úÖ Implemented Service Worker readiness check mechanism"
echo "  3. ‚úÖ Added Service Worker waiting logic to useEmpresas hook"
echo "  4. ‚úÖ Enhanced Service Worker with better debugging and interception"
echo "  5. ‚úÖ Consolidated Service Worker registration to avoid conflicts"
echo "  6. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debugging and timing logs"

echo ""
echo "üîß Timing Improvements:"
echo "  1. Service Worker registration happens on app load"
echo "  2. useEmpresas hook waits for Service Worker readiness before API calls"
echo "  3. All API functions in the hook include Service Worker readiness checks"
echo "  4. Timeout mechanism prevents infinite waiting"
echo "  5. Debug logs show exact timing of API calls vs Service Worker readiness"

echo ""
echo "üõ°Ô∏è Service Worker Features:"
echo "  1. Intercepts HTTP requests to target domain"
echo "  2. Converts them to HTTPS automatically"
echo "  3. Enhanced debugging with timestamps"
echo "  4. Error handling and logging"
echo "  5. Message handling for communication"
echo "  6. Supports multiple target domains"

echo ""
echo "üß™ Testing:"
echo "  1. Service Worker test suite with comprehensive checks"
echo "  2. API endpoint testing after Service Worker readiness"
echo "  3. Debug functions to check Service Worker status"
echo "  4. Timing verification to ensure proper sequence"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Service Worker implementation verification complete!"
echo ""
echo "üöÄ Next Steps:"
echo "  1. Build the application: npm run build"
echo "  2. Test in production environment"
echo "  3. Monitor console logs for Service Worker activity"
echo "  4. Verify Mixed Content errors are resolved"
echo "  5. Check that all API calls work properly"
